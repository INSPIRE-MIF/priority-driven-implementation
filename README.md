# Repository for INSPIRE MIWP Action 2.2 'Roadmap for priority-driven implementation' 
The Action 2.2 “Roadmap for priority-driven implementation” is defined in the [INSPIRE MIWP 2021-2024](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/wikis/display/InspireMIG/INSPIRE+work+programme+2021-24) with the aim to develop an implementation plan to focus implementation efforts towards  maximising data availability, ensuring interoperability and reaching pan-European spatial coverage for a well-defined set of priority data under MIWP Action 2.1.

Certain aspects of the implementation of the INSPIRE Directive (e.g. harmonization of all data in its scope) are still considered as cumbersome or even disproportionate. The broad spatial data scope of the Directive and the high level definition of the data scope through its 34 themes has resulted in a diversified and non-comparable offering across Member States.
The envisaged common landing zone should address these issues whilst being realised in compliance with the existing legal provisions documented in the INSPIRE Directive and its implementing regulations. Under Action 2.1 a commonly agreed prioritisation of the data scope will be pursued. This action will build on this clear data prioritisation and will aim at defining priority-driven technical requirements for the documentation, availability, accessibility and interoperability of data and spatial data services using the flexibility foreseen in the legal framework.
To facilitate a feasible implementation that responds to tangible needs, the identified flexibilities in the legal framework would be used to diversify and where possible relax the technical implementation guidance for what is needed for each data set (e.g. every data set needs to have published metadata, a clearly defined limited number of data sets need to be harmonized ... ).

The action is led by DG ENV, with contribution by the Member States, EFTA countries, European Commission DGs and the EEA. A temporary dedicated sub-group will be established.
